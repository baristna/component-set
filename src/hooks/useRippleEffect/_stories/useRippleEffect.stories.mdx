# useRippleEffect()

#### Hook for adding ripple effect to a component

<br />

<Story name='Overview'>

<br /><br />

## Usage
To use `useRippleEffect` hook, parent component should have `relative` position.

Since `ripple` creates a DOM element with `absolute` position, to prevent ripple effect
to overlap content, child element(s) also have to be `relative` or `absolute` position with
at least `1` z-index.

To display effect at correct position, only the parent component should trigger the `mouseDownHandler`.

You can prevent triggering from child element by adding `pointer-events: none` style to it.

```jsx
const FunctionalComponent = () => {
  const [ripple, mouseDownHandler] = useRippleEffect()

  return (
    <ParentComponent onMouseDown={mouseDownHandler} style={{ position: 'relative' }}>
      {ripple}
      <ChildComponent style={{ position: 'relative', zIndex: 1, pointerEvents: 'none' }}>Click</ChildComponent>
    </ParentComponent>
  )
}
```

<br />

## Disable
Ripple effect has timeout functions that removes ripple particles from the DOM after animation done. Sometimes this removing
functions can be triggered after owner component such as `Button` unmount. It causes memory-leak since ripple state 
tries to change after unmount. To prevent this, `disable` functionality added.
Simply pass `disable` parameter and it won't trigger related functions.

const [ripple, mouseDownHandler] = useRippleEffect({
  disable: true | false
